  <h2>She may be more human then you think</h2>

  <h3>She has many faces</h3>
  <p>When it comes to expressions, Mitsu got it packed down. There's no question
  what her current mood is. Eyes buldging out, ears stapled to her head, hind end
  lowered with her tail slieghtly down as she burns off like a race car driver looking
  like a wild hyena...she's just excited. Maybe she's laying there with her head
  resting on her crossed hands, eyes fixed with a dazed on a random spot all glazed
  up and with a big deep breath and quick exhale...she's bored. This dog really
  knows how to tell you how she's feeling.</p>
  <p>It her exaggerated emtions that help me understand her more and which has
  ultimately helped develope a strong bond with my husk. Which leads me to the next
  topic.</p>

  <h3>The unbreakable husky bond</h3>
  <p>You'll not find a more loyally bonding dog then Mitsu. Now when I say loyally,
  I don't what you to get the wrong idea. She's not the dog that's glued to you 24 hours
  7 days a week 365 days a year. No  no, Mitsu's loyaltly is more based on loyalty to
  the pack. Which consist of her, my male malamute Logan and myself. She of course
  considers herself the queen bee, Logan the entertainment/warmth and I the alfa. Now
  the pack to her mean everything. We'll be doing the general neighborhood sweep, you
  know to make sure her territoies are in order, here comes along another dog. Well
  Mitsu being Mistu, has to make sure they know this is her pack and don't mess with
  us. Now I'm not saying she's a agressive dog, she just gets very protective when
  she's walked on a lease.</p>
  <p>Ah the lease. What a wonderful invention. This brings me to my final topic</p>

  <h3>Never let huskies off the leash</h3>
  <p>Now when I say never, I mean in no way, shape or form unless the area consist of
  4 <strong>sturdy</strong> walls. Sturdy meaning tall with no area to dig under.
  I'll admit, it took me 7 years of her current 8 year life to come to this conclusion.
  When people say huskies have energy and can run, I don't think the people writing
  those blogs know the full extent of that until they experienced Mitsu excaping out
  of the house. As soon as that door is left open, <strong>BAM</strong>, she gone
  like lighting. These are the moments when you realized that all the exercise
  and track don't mean crap, because your 2 year old husky just out ran you. Now I
  don't want anyone getting the wrong impression, she wasn't running around like a
  rapid crazy dog whose's been abused, no, she thinks it's a game. I mean down right
  a game. She'll run a hundred feet, stop, turn her head towards you and wait. As soon
  as your foot moves, <strong>BAM</strong>, she's gone. She taunts you. What kind of
  loyaltyl is that you say? Well to her, she's just doing a little moral booster
  for the pack. I've been covered in swapped water, contracted poison ivy, been
  electricuted and have been scraped and buised playing the, catch me if you can, game
  with Mitsu. Funny thing is I don't think huskies realize how smart people are.
  We have endurance and pacience. After a while I learned that if she keep running
  away, she'll everntually get tired. So I'd let her do her thing. Chase her a little
  here and there. let her burn off like a hyena. Then I wait until she lays down to
  take a break, <strong>BAM</strong>, there I am proucing on her like a panther, and
  preying on its target. All she does is cower and submit. The alfa wins again.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>What have we learned here, huskies aren't the glued to the hip, ankle biting, I
  can't survise a second without you kind of dog. They are a little more wild then
  that or maybe more original then that. They do the pack thing. Which consist of a
  loyality to the pack, but there are never dull moments. She and most husies are goof
  balls full of energy and love, and they usually get along with anyone. These dogs
  have such a precise intuition, they know if your feeling down or up, and they are
  always there to support. Yes Mitsu has been a handful raising from time to time,
  but with all the adventures, experiences and touching moments we've been through,
  I'd never change a thing. I hope to have a lot more fun and crazy years to come.</p>
