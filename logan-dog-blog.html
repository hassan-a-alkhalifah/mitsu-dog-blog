    <h2>He may be big, but he is as gentle as they come</h2>

    <h3>The ladies man</h3>
    <p>What can I say, Logan has and still is, what one would call, a
    ladies man. He always flirts with the females, whooing them
    to their desire. With gentle ear licks and head caressing, he
    makes any female husky fall paws of paw for him. It seems like
    mostly all Logan thinks about is females, marking his territory,
    food and sleeping. Typical male mindset. Sometimes I wonder if
    hes got a lot going in the noggin of his. Hmm...that's a topic</p>

    <h3>The blank stare</h3>
    <p>They say when a dog stares into your eyes they can see your
    deepest emotions. Well Logan's look seems more like he's looking
    right past you. He'll look at you for no reason. Actully, let me
    rephrase that. He'll stare at you for no reason. I need to emphesize
    the right word for you to understand. His look is blank, direct and
    without thought. You'll be in a totally different room doing a slieght
    stretch, then out of no where you'll feel this creepy feeling like your
    being watch. Guess what?...You are. The door sleightly open just enough
    for a peek, but you'll find Logan watching you down the hallway.
    staring at you with that mindless gaze. Ah but what can I say. he's
    such a gud'boyz!</p>

    <h3>The big ball of warm fur</h3>
    <p>Yes Logan is man whore who love the ladies and stares at everything
    with a blank gaze. He may even at time seem to have a few loose screws
    us there, I kid, but never the less, he by far is one of the most
    gental, loving, tolerate animals eveyone who's met him and myself
    ever seen. No matter where you lay or sit, he'll be there with his
    warm self laying on your feet or next to you. He loves to cuddle
    and loves to be cuddle. And when I say he's tolerate, I mean it.
    You can push him around, lay your feet on him, lay on him, what
    ever you do, he seems to alway enjoy and is content. That's probabaly
    why my female husky Mitsu seems to love him so much. She can be her
    alfa and him the warth and support she needs. Those two are a match
    made in heaven. If they aren't wrestling aroud, which he alway lets
    her win, you'll catch them cuddled up together licking on another.</p>

    <p>Logan is the loving warm goof ball support any dog lover would need.
    I wouldn't trade his for anything in the world. I really do hope he
    has some good years left on him because I think the world would be
    a little less bright without it</p>
